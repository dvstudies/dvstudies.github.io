      <div class="description mb-5 pb-5">
        We will start by considering how to work with historical cartographic sources and incorporate them into a digital workflow. With inputs by Klaus Werner (BHMPI), and <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/paul.guhennec" target="_blank">Paul Guhennec (EPFL)</a>,  we will learn what historical maps are of paradigmatic importance for the study and analysis of urban and artistic heritage in the city of Rome, especially considering our use of Vasi’s Itinerario. We will learn about the digitalization of these sources and how to integrate the resulting raster digital images into an online platform that we can use for our excursions and data collection. We will also learn about how to approach the vectorization of these raster images to extract polygons and lines for the objects in the map. Moreover, we will see how those objects have already been entered and documented elsewhere and how we can connect to that information using a linked data approach and OpenStreetMap.

        Then, before the evening keynote, <a href="https://gess.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/person-detail.Mjc3MjQz.TGlzdC81MTIsNjE4MTIwODY=.html" target="_blank">Javier Argota (ETHZ)</a> will introduce the data fetching, collection and integration task for the following day. It will consist of a brief explanation of the devices and frameworks to collect different environmental information in the city as a preface for second day workshop and presentation. The gathered data will be used to illustrate the challenges and limitations of real data workflows regarding fusion and integration for analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
        </br></br>
        To close the day, <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/frederic.kaplan" target="_blank">Prof Frédéric Kaplan</a> from EPFL will give a keynote lecture at 18:00  entitled "Urban Systems and Urban Spatio-Temporal Navigation”. The lecture is open to the public and will also be streamed via Hertziana’s Vimeo channel. Afterward, an aperitif will be served in the tempietto of the Villino Stroganoff.
