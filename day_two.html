      <h2 class="mb-2 subtitle"><strong>Day 2 </strong>: Historical Digital Twins and Sensing the Contemporary City</h2>
      <div class="description mb-5 pb-5">
        ON the second day we will walk through the streets of Rome following the itinerary suggested by Vasi for the prima giornata with the aid of historical cartographical sources. Participants will be asked to document the route in sections by groups with their smartphones and other means, capturing photographs, and taking notes of relevant aspects derived from their research statements. In addition, we will have the possibility of capturing environmental data along the itinerary with portable sensor kits. These data will be integrated into the digital map during the hands-on session later that day.
        </br></br>
        In the afternoon, Elisabbeta Scirocco from the Department of Tanja Michalsky at BHMPI and Alessandro Adamou, Digital Humanities Researcher at BHMPI will present to us the project “Mapping Sacred Spaces”. Later on Pietro Liuzzo from BHMPI will share his reflections of the need and usefulness of using API access to established and renowned accessible online collections in a thoughtful and sustainable way. In addition, he will provide an access point for the participants to explore the assets of the Photographic collection of the Bibliotheca Hertziana and find entries relevant to the landmarks studied along our route in Rome.
        Later, we will move to a workshop format where together with Javier Argota we will see what possibilities are there to explore regarding environmental sensing and we will collectively explore and discuss what types of synergies or emergent questions arised when combining this with other approaches such as historical, cultural herigae focused, and so on.
