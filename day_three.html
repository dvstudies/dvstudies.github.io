Day 3 THEME: Re-Imagining Links between Past and Present
On the morning of the third day,  we will have Paolo Rosati from Università di Roma "La Sapienza”, give us a lecture on the techniques and uses of photogrammetry for cultural heritage. In the afternoon, Prof Renata Ago and Domizia D’Erasmo, also from La Sapienza, will give a lecture on some case studies using Historical GIS methodologies and Alessandro Adamou and Martin Raspe from BHMPI will explain to us the approaches towards embracing a linked data approach and knowledge graph engineering for connecting legacy databases at the Hertziana.

In the afternoon, we will explore a more speculative approach with Iacopo Neri and Darío Negueruela, using state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion)  to re-imagine past and alternative past representations of the urban landscape and landmarks.
