      <h1 class="mt-3 display-1 title"><strong>The City as Collection: building an augmented database for the humanities and social sciences.</strong></h1>
      <div class="description mb-5 pb-5">
        Digitalization is ubiquitous and pervasive. All our approaches, concepts, and methods will surely be permeated by the digital if they are not already. Within the humanities and social sciences, and particularly in the fields of architecture and architectural and urban history, there is an urgent need to rethink the way we build pragmatic, linked and interoperable databases from the ground up, leveraging connections to curated collections and controlled vocabularies.
        </br></br>
        With this block winter school, we propose a hands-on approach to engaging with a digital  workflow and data pipeline for the collection, processing, contextualization, visualization and spatialization of a database of public monuments in the city of Rome. The goal of the workshop is to explore the different phases in a connected and holistic manner so as to better conceive what it takes to build an augmented database fit for the stated research purposes and the challenges faced by future-proof research infrastructures
        </br></br>
        The winter school is conceived in a workshop format, structured by a series of connected exercises that explore different items of the workflow, combined with lectures and presentations that contextualize these in the state of the art and contribute to enriching the collective reflections on the shortcomings and challenges of current data infrastructure efforts for the humanities and social sciences.  We depart from an entry point based on the visual and cartographic, and we gradually expand it to other modalities, building a context to the data collection efforts by the participants through connections to existing historical collections.
        As an entry point to the very rich and historically dense urban landscape of the city of Rome, we will use Giuseppe Vasi’s Itinerario istruttivo per ritrovare con facilità tutte le Magnificenze di Roma e di alcune città, e castelli suburbani, published in 1763, which, accompanied by the series of etchings etchings on the monuments of Rome (Sulle Magnificenze di Roma Antica e Moderna) published over ten books, constitute one of the main reference guides to the Rome of the Grand Tour.
